/*
    Kotlin is a statically typed language like Java.
    That is, the type of a variable is known at compile time.
*/


/*
   Built-in types in Kotlin can be categorized as follows:

    numbers
    characters
    booleans
    Arrays
*/


/*
    Number Type

    Numbers in Kotlin are similar to Java.
    There are 6 built-in types representing numbers:

    -Bytes
    -Short
    -int
    -Long
    - Float
    -Double

   byte

    The byte data type can have values from -128 to 127 (8-bit signed binary integer).

    Used instead of Int or other integer data types to save memory.

    /*

    Short

    Short data type can have values between -32768 and 32767
    (two complementary integers with a 16-bit signature).
    When you are sure that the value of the variable will be within [-32768, 32767],

    Int data type can have values between -2^31 and 2^31-1 ^

    // Similarly, you can use a capital letter L to indicate that the variable is of type Long.

    val newValue = 100L // It is a long type variable.

    val examNote: Double = 99.9 // It is used in dotted numbers.
    println("examNote : $examNote") // Where did you deduct 0.01 points from, ZalÄ±m teacher :)

    In the above program we used 19.5F instead of 19.5.
